    <h1>All about Flask!</h1>
    <p>Flask is a Python module meant for designing websites. Many websites use it, including Facebook and Spotify. It is very lightweight and can be used everywhere. It is very simple to use and I recommend it if you want to quickly launch a website (local website).</p>
